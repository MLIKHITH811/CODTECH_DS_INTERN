**Task 2: Deep Learning Project**

Implemented in: Jupyter Notebook

For this task, I built a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow. The Jupyter Notebook covers:

Data loading and preprocessing (resizing, augmentation).

Constructing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Training and optimizing the model for better accuracy.

Evaluating performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

Visualizing training results using loss and accuracy plots.


This project strengthened my understanding of deep learning and CNNs for image classification.
