**Task 4: Business Optimization Model**

Implemented in: Jupyter Notebook

For this task, I developed a business optimization model using linear programming to solve a business optimization problem with PuLP in Python. The notebook includes:

1.Defining the Optimization Problem and Constraints – Setting up the mathematical structure of the problem.

2.Setting up an Objective Function – Maximizing efficiency or minimizing cost.

3.Implementing the Model – Solving the optimization problem using PuLP's linear programming solver.

4.Visualizing and Analyzing the Results – Generating insights from the optimization results.

Additionally, I applied machine learning techniques, using the retail_sales_dataset.csv for training a RandomForestRegressor model to make predictions.

This project enhanced my understanding of optimization techniques in business decision-making and prediction models for sales forecasting.
